Learning Journey: React, C#, and .NET Full-Stack Development
This project highlights the key concepts and skills I've learned while working with React for the frontend and C# with .NET Core for the backend. It covers both individual technologies and their integration to build a full-stack web application.

What I've Learned in React
In React, I've learned how to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces using components. Some of the core concepts include:

Creating reusable components.
Using hooks like useState and useEffect for state management and handling side effects.
Handling routing with react-router-dom.
Managing forms and integrating APIs using fetch.
What I've Learned in C# and .NET
In C# and .NET, I've focused on building robust back-end services and APIs. Key concepts include:

Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core.
Using Dependency Injection (DI) for better code maintainability.
Working with JSON data.
Performing CRUD operations, handling authentication, and authorization.
Full-Stack Development
Additionally, Iâ€™ve learned how to integrate both the front-end and back-end in a full-stack application:

Building a .NET Core API and interacting with it using React.
Handling authentication with JWT tokens.
Using fetch in React to make HTTP requests to the API.
Dynamically displaying data based on API responses.
